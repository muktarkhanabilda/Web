        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool. Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pour 400ml boiling water over the dried porcini and leave for 10 mins until hydrated. Meanwhile pour 1 tbsp oil into a large saucepan. Add the onion, carrot, celery and a pinch of salt. Cook gently, stirring for 10 mins until soft. Remove the porcini from the liquid, keeping the mushroomy stock and roughly chop. Set both aside.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the garlic and thyme to the pan. Cook for 1 min then stir in the tomato purée and cook for a min more. Pour in the red wine, if using, cook until nearly reduced, then add the lentils, reserved mushroom stock and tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and leave to simmer with a lid on.</p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Meanwhile, heat a large frying pan. Add the remaining oil, then tip in the chestnut, portobello and rehydrated mushrooms. Fry until all the water has evaporated and the mushrooms are deep golden brown. Pour in the soy sauce. Give everything a good mix, then scrape the mushrooms into the lentil mixture. And so on...</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat the oil in a wok over a high heat. Add the onion and cook for 3-4 mins until softened and slightly caramelised. Add the garlic and stir for 1 min.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toss in the carrot and cabbage, then cook for 1-2 mins. Add the rice and stir to warm through. Pour in the fish sauce, soy sauce and some seasoning. Make a well in the centre of the wok and crack in the egg. Fry until the white is nearly set.</p>
    
    
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Serve the rice in a large bowl, topped with the fried egg and drizzled with chilli sauce.</p>
